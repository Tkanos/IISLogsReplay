# IISLogsReplay

I want to create a simple tool that takes IISLogs, Parse it, and then Resend (replay) the requests.
In order to Load Test my servers.

I won't do a big generic project, only a simple project that fits my needs, but if you want to fork it, or even ameliorate it, you're very welcome.
